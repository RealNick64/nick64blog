I am now 19 years old. I don't really feel much different from last year haha. It's kinda interesting to see what I wrote for my birthday last year and compare it to how I feel now. I can't BELIEVE it's already been 1 year since I rewatched The Muppets lmao. Also that Ko-fi never went anywhere, never got a single penny from it, but hey at least it's there I guess lol.

Today I'm just gonna do some random stuff with friends and eat out, and tonight I plan to rewatch Castle in the Sky, so that's gonna be cool. 

I can't really say that my life right now is 100% wonderful, my job has been draining the life out of me and I certainly can't say I love it at all. But it's getting me money, and money makes me happy. If you say money can't buy happiness, you are genuinely wrong. 

Anyways...

So yeah, I'm doing fine. Sorry I haven't updated the site in a while, I also didn't even realize it was down for a while, the VPS I have it on was just... stopped for some reason. Not sure why. Oh well. 

I want to start getting into recording videos too, I just need to figure out a solution for covering my face, so I might try like a papercraft mask or something haha. 

So that's all from me.

Oh, and I'm still working on Blip. I'm in the process of doing a lot in my life so I haven't worked on it in like a week, plus I'm planning to change the way I do drawing from PC to using an Android tablet for it, so it might be a while before anything happens with that, but yes, I am still working on it, I have not given up on it and I hope I never will. It will be some time before anything comes of it though.

Thanks for reading.
