I'm back! ...For a second. I'm not sure if I'm going to be returning to the site long-term or what, but for the time being, here I am. 

It sure has been a bit, two months, since my last post. I'm not really gonna drag this out longer than this needs to be, so I'll just say it now, the reason I haven't written here in a while is that I've just been busy and a bit burnt out on the website. I have a job that takes a lot of my time now, I have a webcomic I want to work on, and only so much time for anything else. And I don't really see this site as a top priority, so I decided that instead of forcing myself to write and do stuff that I didn't feel like doing, I would just wait for the right time, and I think now I feel like doing more stuff with this site maybe. Not a guarantee, but we'll see.

I won't go out of my way to decorate this post and put a bunch of stuff on it, but I do want to talk about what I've been up to the past two months, since it's actually a little bit.

# I bought a Pixel 8 (mint color too!)

So before, I had a Galaxy A51, and I wasn't in a huge rush to buy a new phone, but I was looking into getting one sometime around my birthday in March, ideally a Pixel phone since people had been suggesting it to me a lot. Around the time I was doing research, Google announced a new Pixel 8 and 8 Pro model in MINT COLOR, and I LOVE MINT, so I was pretty excited. That alone didn't make me get it though, what DID make me buy it was the 20% off they were offering on it to some customers through an email coupon. Luckily, one of my friends had this coupon and gave it to me, so I purchased a Pixel 8 Mint for around 600 dollars.

I've been using the phone for about half a month now, and I gotta say, it's quite a great phone. I love the size of the Pixel 8, since it's just small enough that I can comfortably use it one-handed, which is why I went with it and not the 8 Pro. It's a little less wide than my old phone and like a centimeter shorter, so it's a nice size downgrade, since I wanted a smaller phone.

As for the speed, it's a lot more snappier than my old phone, having double the RAM at 8GB, along with a 120Hz display which feels REALLY smooth. Discord doesn't completely shit itself when I use it now, and apps generally have less lag. I'm not really like a gamer or anything, so I can't say much on that, but Fortnite did run better on it than it did on my old phone, so I'll give it that LOL.

The only thing I don't really like on this phone is that the battery is kinda not great on it, but it hasn't been a huge problem for me since I don't really use my phone most of the day, and I always make sure to charge it as often as possible. So it's not a big deal, but do keep that in mind if you want to buy one.

# Snow

Back in December, it snowed in my area. I know that's not that crazy, but it was the first time I really saw snow since I first moved to Arizona, so it was honestly a really special moment for me, and made me appreciate moving back a lot more. It didn't snow like a lot, but it snowed enough to see a layer form. It was really cool honestly.

# Conclusion

Yeah, so I have a lot more that happened than that, but I don't wanna bloat this post, I kinda wanna talk about them over time (if I'm in the writing mood). So I hope you enjoyed my post :)
