Ok, so I was going to write some big thing about why VR as a platform is bad, but the more I think about it, I think it’s just a matter of preference than anything. So instead of writing the worst criticisms possible about VR, I’ll just explain why I personally don’t like it.		

The biggest one is more of a problem on my end than anything else, motion sickness. Some people have issues with this in VR, some don’t. I do, so actually using VR is kind of a pain in the ass for me. 			

Second of all, I’m not a huge fan of the game library. To me, it just seems like most of the library is just shooter games, which makes sense considering they are probably the sort of games that could take advantage of the platform the most, but I’ve never been a fan of FPS games too much, so for me, it’s kind of meh. I’m not saying VR doesn’t have other games, it has many other games that aren’t FPS games, but I feel like most of the library is just shooters.		

I guess another reason is how underwhelming it turned out to be. I was led to believe by others that VR would be this super awesome experience and it’s amazing and all, and in reality, that magic only lasted for like 2 minutes. A big reason for me wanting to invest in VR was because of movies; I wanted to watch movies in a home theater setting because I couldn’t get a setup like that in my place. It turned out to be very underwhelming when I tried it. It could be that the headset was too low-res for my liking, but it just wasn’t it for me.		

Oh yeah, and I guess metaverse stuff sucks too, but I feel like everyone agrees with that, considering corporations are trying to make VR something it really shouldn’t be. At least, not right now. 		

You know, I thought I was going to have more to write about this topic, but I guess I do not. Oh well. Hope you enjoyed my silly rambling or got something out of it, I just need something to write about on here. Maybe I’ll finally write about the PSP sometime.
