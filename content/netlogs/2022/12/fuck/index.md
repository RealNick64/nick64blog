Realized that I didn't post yesterday. Honestly, I don't mind too much because I think I want to try to actually make good content rather than fulfil a deadline and make shitposts. Anyways, today was a wild day, I saw a hit and run with a guy on a motorcycle and other stuff too, it was kinda chaotic and I think I need to rest.

But back to posting, I might start not posting as often so that I have time to craft better posts. Maybe I will still shitpost since it's fun but I don't know. Next post might be a review of something. Not sure.
