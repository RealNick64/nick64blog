As you can see now, the website has quite a different look to it. I'm not really sure if I'll keep it as the final one, but I'm really digging the look of it. It also took me like a week to make because I'm bad at HTML + CSS :(     

Anyways, I hope whoever sees this enjoys it!        

In other news, I have been playing other stuff like Persona 3 now, and also working on my short comic. I feel like I've been doing more stuff to distract myself, but in the end, I still feel not very great... Perhaps I should write about that. Maybe next time I get the motivation to write again.        

It is really late as of publishing, so have a good night.
