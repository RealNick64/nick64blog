Website overhaul again!?!?!? Yeah, I saw the cover art for a song and thought "Woah, OK my site needs to look like this", and here we are. I like it. I put a lot of work into it. I hope you like it too, reader :)  

It's all yellow now, I added fancy CSS stuff, and I also added a newest posts section on the front page, so yipee!

Ok, good night.
