So my old Twitter handle got banned because I was under 13 when I made the account. I set my real birthday on it because I was revamping my profile and uhh yeah. Fuck you, Elon Musk, give me back my account :(


In reality, I’ll just make a new account, with a new handle and everything. Maybe I’ll expand to other sites like Instagram or something so I can spread my site around somehow, I don’t know…. I’ll update with a new post when I get my Twitter stuff figured out, but honestly I don’t really care enough to panic about it right now and fix everything, I have better things to do.
