Got a new Twitter, so woohoo... and hey, I also made a new email! Both are in the "Contacts" tab if you want to contact me. Just wanted to make that post real quick. I'll write some more later today, I'm about to go watch Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 in IMAX, so yay... End of Evangelion is still better. I'll talk more on that later.
