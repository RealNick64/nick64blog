This might not be published on the day I write this due to me not having internet quite yet, but as of writing this right now, it's 7:20am on August 25th, 2023.

It's a nice chilly morning, and I feel like I'm finally able to calm down a bit after all the stuff I had to do this week, starting with moving out.

# Moving out

Moving out was pretty stressful because I live in a large family, and I myself already have a lot, so it took a few days to pack the moving truck, and when we did, it was pretty much filled to the brim, and I MEAN that, it was practically overflowing. And we rented the biggest truck from Penske too. This was probably the most stressful part of it, but it wasn't necessarily the most taxing part.

# Driving

As I stated before, I live in a large family, so when it came to actually getting to Washington, it was honestly not that great at all either. Actually, you know what? If anything, it was kind of awful. 

The first day of it was okay, since some people were in our car and some were split to the moving truck, so it was quieter, but we brought everyone together later on so we could find a hotel and sleep, and those last few hours with them were terrible since they always fight and bicker, and it was tight in the car too. By the time we got to the hotel, I was kinda done with everyone. We got our rooms and I had to share with my brothers, which was awful since I had to share a bed with them and... yeah, it sucked. Not to mention, by the end of that night, I had developed a sore throat, which even right now, I'm still recovering from.

The next day, we drove all together, except for my dad who drove the truck and wasn't even with us at the hotel, and we finished our trip at around 4pm.

# The house

I wasn't expecting a lot from the house itself, since I already saw pics of it, but when I saw it in person, it was a little different than I expected it to be, both in good and bad ways. 

First of all, I was expecting the land to be flatter, but it was actually pretty hilly, which I guess makes sense, I just expected it to be flatter because of how Google Maps showed it. 

The house inside looked worse than I thought it would, not that it was like awful and terrible, but you could tell the people posting the photos definitely had someone edit them to look nicer. In the end though, I wasn't expecting much from the house since it was already pretty crappy anyways (it was built in 1938), but my parents have plans to build a new house on the property, so I guess we'll see how that goes.

# Unpacking

As of now, we're still unpacking, but the process of unpacking itself was actually (at least, so far), a lot easier than packing everything in. I've got pretty much all my stuff unpacked, and the house has its stuff unpacked as well, it's just a matter of getting a bunch of other random stuff like tools off the truck and moved somewhere. I've even unpacked my computer and got my office mostly set up, since I'm writing this now. I'm (for now), not going to be sleeping in here, since it's a room in the basement, and Washington basements (especially in the winter) get CHILLY. But we'll see how it all goes, I've heard it's healthier to sleep seperately from your computer and office, so I want to see if that has any effect on me.

# Conclusion

As of now, it's the third day of me being in this house, and it's weird to adjust being here in Washington again, but it's too soon to say anything conclusively. I really thought I would have more to say about my feelings moving here and all that, but right now, I feel sort of... indifferent? I think I just need more time to settle here and figure things out. But I am excited to soon see all my old friends, make some new ones, and see what the future has for me here in Washington.
