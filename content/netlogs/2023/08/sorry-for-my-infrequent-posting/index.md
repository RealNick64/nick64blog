The people reading my blogs (1, maybe 2) may have noticed that I haven't been posting much recently. I would if I had more time, but sadly, with preparing to move next week, plus also occupying my time with the website overhaul and Minecraft, I won't really be posting much for the next while. Once I find myself in a more stable environment to write, I will start doing that again. 

Hopefully I can finish the website overhaul soon as well. The visuals of the site are overall done, but I'm doing a lot of work on the About Me, plus giving it final touch ups, so I might just upload it as it is sometime this week, but I'll think on it.
