It's been a second since I posted. What happened?

# Massive site revamp in the works

I would have posted more, but I've been busy with a lot of things, and the bigger one (for this site) is that I'm working on a complete visual revamp, along with adding a bunch of new things. I won't show anything from it yet, and I have no estimated release period for it, but it will be up when it's ready. I'm hoping to add more content to explore on the site, along with making it more visually pleasant and interactive. 

# Moving

I have already begun to start packing for my move, which is gonna happen in a few weeks. Actually, as of writing, I have approximately 2 weeks, more or less, until I move. So yeah, my room's looking a lot emptier right now.

Maybe it was too early to start packing, since I have so much time ahead, but I wanted to be prepared in case I needed to do stuff in the meantime, like hanging out with friends. Or getting my license....


# Getting my driver's license

My test is this Wednesday. I have been extremely nervous about it since I feel the need to get it done before I move, and I haven't driven in a while, nor have I mastered all the aspects of it, so I've just been speedrunning a bunch of things and learning before my test so I can have the highest chance of passing. Right now, my driving is... okay. What I'm worried about the most is being nervous on the test and messing up. I feel like that's just a huge snowball of nervousness waiting to crack with that sort of mentality, but I guess we'll see what happens when I take the test. I have one more day to practice, so I'll use that the best I can and pray that I pass... and get a good test administrator... and I'm not too nervous...

# Writing and drawing

I have been working on comic projects very slowly. It may not be a lot, but it's still progress, so I'm happy about that. Hopefully by the end of this month, I can get something uploaded to get it done with instead of sitting on them forever...

(UPDATE from one day after I started writing this initially: I finished the first small comic project I was working on, so hopefully it's uploaded today or soon, so yay :D)

# Playing Minecraft again (Better Than Adventure)

Recently, the friend group I talk to has been talking about starting another Minecraft server after the last one died after a couple of weeks, and so Mr. Jame of [realjame](http://realja.me) started up a Beta 1.7.3 server, but with a twist... it would be running Better Than Adventure.

Initially, I was a bit skeptical, since I wasn't that big on Minecraft in general, let alone Beta versions of Minecraft, since I burnt myself out of Minecraft permanently years ago. But I saw the trailer for the latest version that came out a couple of days before our server, and it looked cool. So I tried it and I've actually been having a lot of fun with it so far. 

Knowing me, I will probably get burnt out after a week or two, but I guess we'll see what happens.

# The end

Yeah, so things are happening, I'm going through some big things now, and it's a little bit nervewracking, but even this is the calm before the storm that's gonna be moving everything. But after that, it *should* be smooth sailing. I will move there, probably look for a new job, and then just put my life on cruise control from there until college comes around.
