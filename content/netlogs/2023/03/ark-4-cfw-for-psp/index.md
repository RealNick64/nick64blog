It was only last night that I actually learned about this CFW existing. It's apparently supposed to be a "new, updated, improved, and modern CFW for PSP and Vita's ePSP", so that's cool. It looks like it has some pretty nice improvements like plugins, Popcorn, which is for PS1 games, etc, but I didn't think much of it. At least, not until I scrolled down on their GitHub, where they mention:

"Region Free playback of UMD Video on all PSP models. Change the region of your UMD drive on-the-fly."

FINALLY OH MY GOD FINALLY YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS YIPEEEEEE HURRAYYYYYYY!!!!

I can finally watch my region-locked UMDs on my Japanese PSP!!!

I will be properly installing it sometime soon, but I don't think there will be much improvement for me personally, besides region-free UMD Video of course, so that's awesome. Thank you, ARK-4 devs! :)
