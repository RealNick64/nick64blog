I want to write more. I remember having this sort of bias towards writing and reading over other forms of media because I was into the visual arts, so I wanted to make games or comics or movies or stuff like that. And I kept trying over and over again to make projects, and while I learned a lot, I also failed and never finished anything. I feel like writing sets the bar lower for me but lets me express myself a lot still.       

When I think about it, I don't really understand why I hated writing. I think I did prefer visual arts, but it wasn't a reason to hate. I don't really know... I'm glad I'm writing more though, both narrative and personal writing, with the blog, short stories, etc. I'm actually getting things *done* for once. It makes me feel happy.       

Well, anyways that's the end of my 12am rant. Good night.
