One day, my networking stopped working on my server. For context, I was running Ubuntu Server. I am not a big tech expert, so I could not figure out what was wrong, so I tried reinstalling Ubuntu Server, but even that didn't work. So Jame (realja.me) suggested I install Debian, so I did, and not much has changed so far, but it does help to have a desktop environment for troubleshooting. Apparently, my system will be more stable, so I hope so. I don't want to have to reinstall my OS again...
