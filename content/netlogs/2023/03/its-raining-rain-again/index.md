Today the rain is hitting hard, which I love. Earlier I was working and my window was open, letting in the sounds of the rain trickling and hitting the ground, and the occasional boom of thunder. It's sets a really nice mood for working, in my opinion, and I generally love rainy weather as a whole. But I live in Arizona, so that's a shame haha.		

Today has been alright, I actually made progress on some personal projects, mainly writing wise. I've been working on something that I hope to publish soon on my website. I don't know how good it will be recieved, but it's an idea that's been in my head for a bit and I wanted to write it down as a story. So no promises, but I do hope to finish a chunk of it so I can actually publish it here. 		

The second project is another story, but I'm also incorporating pictures so I can practice art. That one already has the writing done, I might want to make some small edits, but the main hurdle is the drawing of the pictures. I felt it would do very well to practice drawing more pictures of stuff like that, so that's why I'm working on that. And again, no promises.			

In the end, I don't really care whether or not I actually finish and publish these or not... well, maybe a little, but the point is that each time I fail, it's a learning experience. And if I don't fail, then that's good too! I think my issue is that I can't commit to these projects though. I read about planning fallacy online and I think that's exactly what I'm going through. In the end, all these sorts of projects take time and lots of work to make good, but I tend to underestimate that work because I think of it in my head and it seems really good, but I don't properly take into account what it takes to get that done. Maybe I need more discipline to avoid distracting myself or my thoughts drifting away somehow, since that's a huge issue of mine...		

Well, anyways, not much going on today. Have a good day.
