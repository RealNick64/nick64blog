I added a new "Writing" tab to my website to post all my stories and writing! Whether it will be good or not, though? Eh, up to you. I'm posting these here as a way to get myself to loosen my overthinking mindset and to GET MY STUFF OUT THERE ALREADY! I have something already posted there, so I hope you check it out and enjoy it! It's not finished, but I will be working on it in the coming time.          

I will also be working on new blog posts soon enough, I'm going back to school tomorrow and will be hard at work with that, plus I have work, so who knows what time I have to do that?    

Have a good day (or night)!
