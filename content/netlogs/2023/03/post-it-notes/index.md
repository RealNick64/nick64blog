Started trying to organize my daily tasks with sticky notes, mainly because I find myself getting constantly distracted during the day and sometimes, I feel like I have nothing to do, so this should solve both problems by telling me *what* I need to be doing. I started today, so I hope this lasts because so far it seems good.
