It has been a little over a week now since I got my Steam Deck, so this is how it's been so far. It's been...       

...really good! Really, really good! I love the Steam Deck so far, I've been using it to mostly play Persona 5, but I also have tried other titles, such as Hi-Fi Rush, Resident Evil 2, and dabbled in emulation with Persona 3 FES (with HD textures and mods), and Breath of the Wild, and everything runs really well. Even more intense games, like Resident Evil 2, can run at 40FPS, which to me is perfectly acceptable. It's been making me want to play games more now, so I can finally use this to get through my backlog of games hopefully.   

Would I recommend this?     

YES. ABSOLUTELY YES. Screw Nintendo Switch, buy this!!!
