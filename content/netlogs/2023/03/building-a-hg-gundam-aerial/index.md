A while back, I bought this kit from Target to build. It looked really cool and I wanted to build it, even though I haven't seen the show.      

The box itself looks really nice, it's got a somewhat simple but sleek look. Time to open it.

Ooooohhh, colors.

Stickers, too.

Here's the manual...

And my tools! Not a lot (and I didn't even use the cement, it was just in case).

## Several days later...

Here it is! My posing is not the best, but I really like how this looks. It also helps that I added lots of outlining with my outlining pens and stuff. Not a lot to say here, I just wanted to show this off.
