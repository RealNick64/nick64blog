I am now 18. Things do not feel too much different than yesteday. The weight of responsibility I now have has not set on me yet.        

I didn't do too much today, I just went to a water park, ate some cheesecake at home, rewatched The Muppets (2011), and... yeah. That's kinda it, it wasn't super eventful, but I'm happy that way, I don't want to be overwhelmed or tired or anything, I just want to enjoy myself. I wish I had more to say about it, but that's all. I am an adult now, so that's neat...     

Offtopic, but some news regarding the site...

# I added a Ko-fi!

Now visitors can donate as little as 1 dollar to widdle ol' me. Isn't that neat? I don't really know if I *will* get anything, but it's nice to have it there as something of a fundraiser for myself. So if you actually like the stuff I do here, a tip would be cool. Or not, I don't really mind honestly. I will probably work on making more content like art and writing for this site so that I can justify getting donations, but for the time being, yes, they're there and you can donate if you want.

Secondly, more of news for me, my Steam Deck is coming on Friday!       

...Well, that's what UPS says. It could be earlier, or later. Or maybe the driver will steal it. I don't know. We shall see.        

I mentioned writing earlier though, yes I really want to get into writing! I really want to write stories, and coming up with them is fun, but the actual writing part is my big issue, so I feel like making something and publishing it here (as bad as it may be) will help me learn to be a better writer and storyteller. So hopefully, eventually, I will write stuff to put here. I have some ideas for some short stories to write.     

Anyways, thanks for reading, and have a blessed day!!! :D
