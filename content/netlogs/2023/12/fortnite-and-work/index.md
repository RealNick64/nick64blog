Well, today's Sunday (editor note: as of writing), and I was going to type out a post, but I've decided to do another text to speech post again, so hopefully the text (and my thoughts) doesn't get messed up by the time I finish this.

My life's been... okay. Not really great, but not really terrible. The only thing I've really got going on right now is primarily just my job, and I've finally started playing Fortnite after abstaining from it for such a long time now.

# Update on my job

So far, it's been a few weeks since I've gotten my job, and I've had to deal with understaffing and stress. This is the first time I've ever done food service before, so that also adds to the stress of this job. And as time goes on with this job, people are leaving over time, which is a little bit demotivating. I don't have a lot of free time either, since my only days off are Sundays and Mondays, and Sundays aren't really free since I'm dragged to church half the day.

This job only lasts until January so I might just stick with my current schedule for now and just put up with it, but if things get worse, I might have to adjust my schedule or leave or something, I don't know.

But for the time being I'm coping well enough with the job, and it pays, which is what matters most, so for now, I'll stick with it.

# Fortnite

To lighten up the mood of this post a little bit, this week I started playing Fortnite for the first time, after staying away from the game for many years, thinking that it was "cringe" to play the game. But at this point, I don't really care anymore, and a lot of my friends are playing it, so after seeing the hype with the new season, I decided to start playing the game.

I started a couple days before the new event started so I got to see a little bit of the OG map, which was cool. Eventually, I got to see the event with my friends, and soon enough, the actual modes came out and I've now tried all three of them.

The three new modes in this season are Fortnite Festival, which is a new rhythm game mode created by Harmonix, the devs of Rock Band and Fuser, LEGO Fortnite, which is basically just Fortnite's version of LEGO Worlds, and Rocket Racing which is supposed to be a racing mode that takes from Rocket League.

My least favorite one is the LEGO Fortnite mode, because of the fact that I don't really like Minecraft-esque open world sandbox games. I'm already so exhausted with Minecraft that anything similar just makes me feel even more exhausted. This game mode also feels kind of bare-bones, which is understandable since it's all in Fortnite, but regardless it's still not really that fun to play in my opinion, and when I do play it, I can't really tell what I should be doing, since there's not enough to do or build to make it fun to play as a proper sandbox game.

However, the other two modes on the other hand are actually pretty fun, especially Rocket Racing. I thought my favorite mode would be Fortnite Festival since my favorite kind of games nowadays are rhythm games, but because of the lack of songs that I actually care about (plus the lack of support for Guitar Hero style controllers at the moment) it's currently my second favorite mode of the event. 

I'm genuinely surprised by how much I actually liked Rocket Racing. It is kind of bare bones, just like all of the other events, but again, this is all being made inside Fortnite, so I can understand that. However, I actually had a lot more fun than I thought I would. It's really fun to race with your friends, and playing on a controller feels really good, it just feels nice to control.

So overall, this event has some bad parts of it but for the most part it's actually pretty good.

And now to get to the actual gameplay of Fortnite, the Battle Royale. I never really played many Battle Royale games prior to this, so this was kind of a new experience for me, but once I got the hang of it I've actually started to kind of like it a lot.

I also noticed that I've started spending money on this game once I saw some of the skins that were available, such as Raven Team Leader, but I hope I don't make this a habit. I will probably have to create some sort of limit for myself haha.

Anyways overall I'm having a lot more fun with Fortnite than I thought I would, so it might end up becoming a game that I play long-term.

# Website and Blip

I feel bad for not updating this site very much nowadays since I've been so busy with work and, not to mention my webcomic, which is taking more priority over my website due to me wanting to fulfill my bi-weekly schedule that I've now created for myself. As of now, Chapter 4 should be out on GlobalComix, so please go read that, along with the other previous chapters if you haven't already. But now that I've gotten Chapter 4 uploaded, I've already started working on Chapter 5. I actually finished Chapter 4 on Friday night and I started working on Chapter 5 right after Chapter 4. I'm hoping to create a buffer in the future so that I may have time to work on other projects such as posting new art on Twitter, or just having free time to myself. 

It's a little bit scary seeing a project like this that I'm working on now up on the Internet and free for people to read for the first time. It's intimidating, but I want to do this because this project will help strengthen my creative abilities and get myself to not be afraid to show people the work that I create, because in the end, the whole point of this webcomic isn't to create an astoundingly good story with great art or anything like that, but rather to use it as a creative scratch pad to explore ideas that I think have potential and see what sticks and what doesn't, which is why the art looks meh.

I'm not aiming for perfection with this webcomic, I just want to make something that makes me happy and lets me do whatever I want without my perfectionism getting in the way. This certainly doesn't mean that I'm not open to criticism, if anything, I'll use this to become less afraid of criticism, but I don't want this project to devolve into me getting burnt out because I'm putting too much effort into it.

Gonna just end the post here since I'm rambling at this point. Thanks for reading :)
