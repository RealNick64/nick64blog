It's been a few days since I wrote here, so why not catch up?

## Working a job

I've been working at my job for the past few weeks now and it's been okay. I don't love it but I don't hate it. It's a food service job, which makes me surprised that I'm dealing with it fine since I've never done food service before and I've always stayed away from those sorts of jobs, but it's not that bad. This is a seasonal job, so I'll be let go by January, but it should be fine since I'll see if I can get rehired in the store, since it's not just food service. I'm glad I took this job since I definitely felt like I've been a little toughened up, which was my idea for taking this job. 

## Blip

My new webcomic, Blip, released about a week ago now, and I'm currently working on Chapter 4 right now, which that, alongside my job, is the main reason I've neglected this site for a bit now. I think the new chapter should come out by the end of this week/beginning of next week with the pace I'm working at it on. I think I need to put more time on it during the day, since I only put an hour or two on it. Regardless, I don't wanna push myself too much, so I'll try to push more time into it while not overwhelming myself. 

## Root beer

I've been in the mood to drink root beer for some reason. So today I went to Fred Meyer and got a bottle of root beer and vanilla ice cream so I can make a root beer float. Gonna try it later today, so I hope I enjoy it.

Thanks for reading, sorry for the lackluster post, I just don't have a lot to say at the moment. :)
