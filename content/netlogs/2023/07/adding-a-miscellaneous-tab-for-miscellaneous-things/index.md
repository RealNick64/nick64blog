Currently working on adding a "Misc" tab so I can have some sort of gateway to make more obscure and niche pages for this site. The tab is there, but the page is under construction, so yeah. 

Soon, I will also be reworking the entire "About Me" section, but my plan is a bit ambitious and requires artwork, so it's gonna be a while before I finish that. 

Someday, I need to redo the "Info" page as well.... Oh, well.

For those that browse my site and actively use it... thank you! From the bottom of my heart. Genuinely. If you really enjoy it, feel free to send me an e-mail telling me how much you absolutely super duper love it x100000000000. Or send me criticism. That too.
