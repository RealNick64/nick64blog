I've been working on an older layout for my website for old browsers. I wanna see if I can get my site fully working on a really, really old browser. It would be cool. Anyways, I'm trying to work on some parts of the site, like the About Me, so who knows how long it will take before I finish, we'll see. Hopefully soon.
