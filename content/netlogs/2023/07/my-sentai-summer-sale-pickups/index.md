Today, I got my stuff I ordered from Sentai's summer sale. I bought these three because they were extremely cheap. The only one I bought with the intention of watching from the start was Flip Flappers, these other two were both 5 dollars each, so I bought them as a blind buy, and I'll be watching them soon sometime. My total spent was about 20 dollars, so I got out of the sale pretty good!
