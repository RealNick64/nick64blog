Today, I went to Barnes and Noble and Savers, and picked up a few things. I first went to Barnes and Noble and got a One Punch Man volume to add to my collection, along with a Promised Neverland volume to replace my old one since it had some really bad misprints. I saw that they had Criterion Collection movies for 50% off, but I needed to conserve my spending and decided against getting anything else.

After that, I stopped at Savers to try to look for an iPod or a Zune, but found none... Disappointed, I went, to electronics and found this PlayStation 2 DVD remote there for 3 dollars. Decided "Eh, why not?" and bought it. 

And uhh, yeah. That was pretty much it for today.
