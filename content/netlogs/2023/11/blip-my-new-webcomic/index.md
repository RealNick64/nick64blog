I've been talking about this (and trying to work on it) for a very long time now, but it's finally here.

My new webcomic is titled Blip, and the first three chapters are out now to read on GlobalComix!

I've been working on these first few chapters throughout the year, and despite the quality of the comic itself so far, I've learned a lot about the process of it all, and I have a clearer vision of the story for this project of mine. Although the focus of this project is to push past my perfectionism and create a project that may not be perfect (or even good, for that matter), I still want to do my best to make this as good as I can make it, so I would appreciate your support by continuing to read the comic after this, once new chapters come out.

I will probably update my site to have a section for the comic. That way, I can provide content on the site, plus updates for new chapters, and all that.

With all that being said, at the moment, I'm working on the draft for chapter 4, so look out for that in the future, and thanks for reading :)
