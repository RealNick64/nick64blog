I'm not gonna write much, but I just wanted to say happy Thanksgiving! I'm gonna be relaxing today and not doing a lot, just working on my stuff.

Speaking of my stuff, the first three chapters of my comic are basically done now! I plan on uploading them soon, so I'll make some update regarding that in the near future hopefully, the next hurdle is just converting all my Krita files to whatever I need for the website I plan to use.

Other than that, yeah I'm not doing much, just working and stuff, getting moolah. December is coming up, so that's nice.

Enjoy your Thanksgiving, guys.
