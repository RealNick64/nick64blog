This morning, I woke up to a really nice rainy sky. The weather is really nice right now, so I'm kind of in a good mood.

With this new mood in mind, I'm setting myself to be more productive. And what better way to be productive than to write a review on the Five Nights at Freddy's movie?

# It was alright

I have an important thing to say before I go into this. I'm NOT a FNAF fan. I've barely played the games, I only know a bit of the lore, and that's it, so this review is less a fan's perspective and more an outsider's perspective. Nonetheless, I thought it was alright. Not great, but not terrible either.

I think it's interesting that they changed some of the lore aspects to fit with the movie and make more of a story. For example, giving a reason for Mike to do all he does by introducing his brother into the movie. I feel like it's stupid that Afton killed his brother because maybe OG lore-wise, it makes sense, but in the movie, it feels so forced, so IDK. 

Overall, an alright film, good for the fans, good fanservice, but IDK I don't care for it much. But that's just a theory.
