I feel drained. Like, I don't know, I'm being dragged in all directions. School, college, work, driving lessons... it's a little much, I don't know. I feel a bit better after just being left alone for a bit, but I do wish I had more people to talk about it to. Back to writing after a while, not finishing this. GN
