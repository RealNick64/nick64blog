Kind of just vibing with a nice ol' headache after being in a car for a few hours earlier today, and I also mentally feel bleh too. Not really sure why, but I just sometimes feel like I feel really out of place with my friends, and that I'm constantly saying something wrong and... I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I get that feeling every once in a while, like I'm like some douche, or an outlier in a group. Sometimes, I do or say things that just make me seem like a douche, and I don't *try* to be that way, it's just my way of being an attention-seeker, in the end. Going 2 bed now, gn.
