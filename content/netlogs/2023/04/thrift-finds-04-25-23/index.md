My thrift finds on Monday. I found a few things, went to a Savers and two Goodwills, and overall, spent about 90 dollars, more or less (the Savers stuff, like the i7, was all half off). Pretty awesome finds, I think I will probably do some stuff with the guitar since I want to get into Clone Hero but I also want to mod it for the awesomeness of it, and it will be fun :)

If I do that, def will make a blog post on it.
