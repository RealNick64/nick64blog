Why do I keep doing this lol

I'm supposed to be saving money, but I just dropped 70 bucks on this after seeing the new Sonic sets, mainly out of fear that it was gonna go out of print soon. So, yeah. It was just 70 bucks, but I still feel horrible for buying it. Hopefully when I finish building it, that guilt will leave me.... I will make an update once I finish this set, but it might take a while because I have a busy weekend :(
