Today, I went to Great Wolf Lodge.       

I have one really close to my house, and my family decided to go as a somewhat late Christmas gift. I thought it was okay but... I don't know. I went to another park in Washington and I felt like it had more, it was a bigger building, had more intense rides, all that. This park felt very small and tame in comparison. And I know I'm literally critiquing a kids water park, but I don't care haha, I wanna write about this. The slides were mostly the same, but they toned them down more and they're kinda lame in comparison to the older slides. The building is more modern, so I'll give it that.      

Yeah, not much else to say, I guess. Except "haha furry hotel".
