Well, it's been a week, what happened in 2023 so far for me? 		

Not much, I did get some new stuff like more camera equipment and stuff. Oh yeah, I watched Parasite blind, very good movie, I liked it a lot. I'm not really sure what else to write here honestly. I know this is supposed to be more like a diary than some official blog thing, but I still don't have a lot to write here. I wish I did, but at the same time, I don't have a lot of motivation to write here without having content to write about. But oh well... I'll see what happens.				

Hope everything is alright with anyone reading right now. Have a good day :)
