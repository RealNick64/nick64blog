I haven't written here in a week. I don't really think it's a good or bad thing, I don't want to bloat my site, but at the same time, I also want to write more so I don't know. Anyways.

I was sick for like half the week, still am a tiny, tiny bit, so that wasn't fun. But today was fun, I got to see the new Puss in Boots movie in theaters. I won't make a big long review, so I'll just make a quick summary of my thoughts here really fast:       

It was pretty good, it was a good start for 2023 (even if it came out in 2022, but shh) animated films. Besides the obviously Spiderverse-inspired visuals (which were awesome, good job Dreamworks keep your streak going), the story was pretty good, but nothing super stand out. I really like Death, like many people online seem to do, and I think the conflicts Puss goes through are pretty good, the wedding stuff felt a tad shoved-in, but led to a good conflict between him and Kitty, so oh well. I like Jack and the little conscience, I thought they were funny, and the Goldibears were alright, they felt like a plot device at first, but turned into a group I actually cared about by the end.       

Perrito :\      

Yeah it was good.

I also bought a figure of Simon from Gurren Lagann today, and it's pretty cool but the store I got it from didn't have Kamina :( They had Yoko tho, but I don't want her so idk.        

I've also been looking into trying to fix my overthinking habits and trying to change my way of thinking about things. When working on my projects, I have this nauseating expectation for myself to do the best I possibly can, but I don't really ever feel happy about my work, I just go along with it, and it just makes me feel bad. So I want to try doing some new things to improve that, perhaps read some self-help books, watch some videos, reflect for myself, I don't know. Just something I want to bring awareness to myself about more.       

Anyway, that's all for now.
