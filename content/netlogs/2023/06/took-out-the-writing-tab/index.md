Decided to take out the Writing tab since I felt like it was going nowhere, and I don't really like writing. Right now, my focus is the comic, so I'm gonna take this section down since it has no real value. It technically still exists tho, if you just add "/writing" to the website link, but nothing is there, so :/

I also added new tags: Music, Site Updates, Life, and Movies/TV. Just to make it more better organized than it was before. And I went through my old posts and quickly updated the tags on all of them.
