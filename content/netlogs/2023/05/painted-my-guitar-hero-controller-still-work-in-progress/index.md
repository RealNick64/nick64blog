I painted my Guitar Hero controller that I bought a while back (check out "Thrift Finds (04-25-23)"). It's not perfect, nor is the guitar itself close to being done, but I'm really proud of how it's coming along so far. Next, I'm painting the center part and I'm gonna install a Pi Pico so that I can use it on my PC (since this is a PS2 Wireless Kramer Guitar). Gonna post this and enjoy some mac n' cheese. Later, gater :P
