Today, I went into Seattle to walk around and explore a bit. 

It was kinda nice, I walked around University Village and I walked out to get to Pink Gorilla Games. It took about like 20-25 minutes to walk there though, but the route there was actually very nice and pretty.

# At Pink Gorilla

When I got to Pink Gorilla, I sorta took my time inside, looking through all the PS2, PSP, and Vita games. In the end, while there were games I was interested in, they weren't top priority for me, and I didn't wanna spend too much money, but one game did make me interested. It was sealed and 30 bucks, which for a Vita game, doesn't sound bad at all, so I bought it.

That game was...

# Lumines: Electronic Symphony

I've never played this game before, but I am in LOVE with Lumines on the PSP, so I imagine this game must be pretty similar. And also, I wanted to try to go into something blind, so this felt like a good choice to try. I don't think I'll open it, since I can just load the file for it on my Vita using my PSVSD. Speaking of which, my PSVSD IS STILL NOT HERE!!!!!

Oh, well. Patience is a virtue, I guess, so I'll try to not think about it too much. I just wish I could use my Vita...

That's all for today. I'll probably spend the rest of the day on YouTube or working on my small comic. I'll see.
