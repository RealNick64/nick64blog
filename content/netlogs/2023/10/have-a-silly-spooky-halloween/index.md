Heeeeehheeeehahahahahahaaaahoohohooooooo.... it is Halloween!!!!!! 

...I don't really celebrate it, but I wanted to write a post about it for the sake of the holiday.

It's not a holiday I celebrate because of le Christian parents, but I do enjoy the vibe of the holiday, so that's why I wanted to make a post about it. I will probably spend my Halloween watching a movie in call with friends or something.

I don't have a lot to say beyond that, but I am excited to get that clearance candy after Halloween ends :) 

Happy Halloween, reader.
