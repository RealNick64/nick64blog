Ok, so remember how last post, I said hopefully the new revamp would be coming in the future sometime?

Well, I thought about it for a bit, and it just pains me to keep working on the revamp, which is mostly done, and just be constantly working on small touch ups and other random stuff like images that I might not use and don't have the creative juices to make at the moment. So instead of delaying it more, I decided to wrap things up for the time being and just upload what I have now to show what I've been up to for the past while.

If you're reading this right now, chances are you can probably already tell the difference, and if not... then I don't know, but I'll go through some differences anyways because I need to fill this post with content.

# Homepage

{{< image src="images/home-page.jpg" alt="A before and after comparison of my home pages (left is old, right is new)">}}

As you can see, some new things are here and some old things are gone, like how the YouTube section is now gone from the new page, but it also introduces that giant image in the center there.

# The Bedroom

{{< image src="images/bedroom.jpg" alt="A picture of the Bedroom page in the new redesign">}}

The Bedroom is pretty much the place I put the most effort in. It's not fully complete, but the desk and bookshelf sections are, so feel free to explore around and see some cool stuff about me.

# Netlogs/Art

{{< image src="images/netlogs.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the old and new netlogs layout on my website.">}}

The netlogs are different in some ways too. The biggest change is that netlogs no longer stretch the page down to the length of the post, but are rather put in a container with a scrollbar. I thought it would be cooler to do that, so that's why I did it, and I really like it.


# Overall...

Yeah, the fundamentals of the site are kind of unchanged, but a lot of visual things are, and new things have been added that I hope whoever comes across this site will enjoy. I don't really have much else to say besides that, so yeah, thanks for reading :)
