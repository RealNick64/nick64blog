A couple of days ago, I went out with a couple of friends from my high school to Everett Mall to hang out. It was actually kind of fun.

# Walking and shopping

We spent a decent amount of time walking around and shopping around at some stores. Some of my friends ordered boba *several* times, while I only got food at the end, where we ate at Jack-in-the-Box. They had an arcade there, which had some cool games, like Mario Kart, Minecraft Dungeons, but the one that stood out to me was Guitar Hero.

I tried to play the game a little, being familiar with some of the songs on there, but I put on a poor show in front of my friends because I hadn't warmed up and the little notch on the yellow button was worn, so it was hard for me to get a mental image of where my hand was on the guitar lmao.

We all played some Minecraft Dungeons Arcade afterwards. It's a 4-player game, which was perfect since we were a group of 4, so we played it for a few minutes and then walked out of the mall.

They had a HobbyTown there, so we walked in and checked out their selection of model kits. I was mainly interested in the Gundams though, and while I didn't get any that day, I did get myself some Mr. Mark Setter for water decals that I never applied previously on my Gundams, so I'll get to that eventually.

From there, we walked to Half-Price Books, which was fun to look through (despite their overpriced items), and I did spot an Evangelion DVD, which I wanted to get for my collection of EVA merch since it was one I didn't own yet and it was ***SEALED***, but...

60 bucks? Yeah, no thanks.

After that, we went to Walmart to get some drinks and to Jack-in-the-Box to eat, where we sat and talked for a bit before we all split off and left. 

It was a really fun time hanging out with some of my friends, especially since I hadn't seen some of them since before COVID hit. I'm glad that I had the chance to hang out with them again, and I hope to do more in the future.

# P.S. minor site updates

I added my button again in the Info page, but it's not updated to look like the rest of the site so I'll figure that out in the future. Also added a new Bed page and fixed some stuff with the Neocities redirect. Pretty much it.
