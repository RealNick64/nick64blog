Finally got the Gurren Lagann box set in my mail today after ordering it on the RightStufAnime Black Friday sale and waiting a week for it to arrive. Being my first Aniplex box set, DAMN was it expensive. But it was worth it, it's really nice. I haven't finished the series yet but I wanted it because it was fire. Will waste more moneyz on future box sets in the future.
