I'm about to go to work, but this was a thought I had for a bit every once in a while. My boss will sometimes say not to do something, and somehow, I don't know how he does it, he sounds serious, but also sounds like he's joking at the same time. The past few times he's done this to me, I was yawning because I work later in the day, and he said "No yawning!" in that same way I mentioned before. I genuinely can't tell if he seriously means it or not. It sounds like such a silly thing to not allow, but at the same time that feels like something that would be frowned on by the higher ups of where I work at (a retail store, for context). I'm about to go into work in half an hour, but I just wanted to write about it because it was sort of confusing and I'm not really sure what to think of it, haha... It's just a funny thing to me.
