Today I undervolted the CPU on my home server, so now I can save a little bit more moneyz on power!

That's neat, I guess.       

Also plan on upgrading the drives in the future so that I have more space for awesome doodads (pirated movies and TV shows heheheha), and for backup storage too. Not only that, I also want to try to use the server for more things, like setting up Searx or a home VPN for places that I can't use ExpressVPN at (like school or smth idk). Even if it won't be that useful, it'll be a fun and enlightening experience for me, and I think that's what matters most.       

Good night, guys! :)
