RING POP GAMING!!!!

{{< center-image link="images/ring-pop.jpg">}}

For real though, no more weird posts for a sec. Sorry for not saying a lot recently, I've been busy with school and work and... life, in general. I want to work on the website, and I will still be posting daily here, but fixes and adding new stuff will be kind of slow for a while. I hope to get to it as soon as possible, but at the same time, I also need to work on other projects as well. I wanted to use this website to host said projects, so I should probably get to them now that I have a site to put them on lol. I should also post more art here from my old Twitter sometime. But yeah, have a wonderful day guys, and to those reading, thank you.
