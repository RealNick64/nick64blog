            <h2>Chapter 1: The Woman on Camera</h2>
            <p><i><b>This website is a compilation of camera feeds from around the world, from webcams to smartphones to security cameras. Feel free to upload any you find as well. Enjoy :)</b></i></p>

            <p>
                The small message sat on the top of the dull dark gray website, and below it, a black box with a small play button in the middle.       
            </p>  
            <p>
                I lowered my fork after I finished taking a bite out of my steak, gently clanking down on the plate Around that time, I made a habit of going through websites I found online, either on the surface web or dark web, clicking and hopping through directories compiled by users and webrings to see what websites would catch my eye. I went through many websites of different kinds before stumbling across this one and typically, I should’ve avoided the site, but something about the ominous presentation of it, the thought of the live feeds… It made me morbidly curious. I hesitated for a moment, worrying that maybe something disturbing would appear, or my data would be wiped somehow, or something along the lines of that, but I willed myself to click the play button.
            </p>
                It took a few seconds, but suddenly the whole page reloaded, and the box turned from an empty black to a muddy colored video. Immediately, I noticed a fine looking black-haired lady with a nice, but casual suit, sitting at a corner desk, typing away furiously at a keyboard out of view while she stared intensely, but very tiredly, at her monitor. She was surrounded by flimsy gray walls with an opening on the side, and I could barely make out the background details of the black binders on the shelf behind her, or the picture frame on her left, angled away from the camera view. Everything else was obscured by the low resolution of the video. 
            <p>
                I was surprised that the video wasn’t anything else, and it seemed... legitimate enough. My eyes drifted away slightly in thought, but went back up as soon as she stopped typing to adjust the collar on her shirt. Her arms formed an arch on the table and she rested her chin on her hands. She looked exhausted, I assumed from toiling away in that cubicle for hours on end. 
            </p>
                I had a job like hers once, sitting for hours on end in an office with papers and monotone scenery, being told what to do all the time and working the energy out of myself. Seeing her tired look, her dissatisfaction… I felt some kind of connection with her, like we weren’t too dissimilar. It made me wish I could… just hop into the video and try to comfort her, or offer a coffee to bring her energy up, or something… I stared at her for a long moment. She had beautiful eyes, a nice face, she looked like somebody with a perky personality… outside of the job.
            <p>
                I let out a low sigh and picked up my fork to eat another piece of steak. I chomped it down and grabbed my mouse to bookmark the page for later, in case maybe I wanted to check on her again. I stared at her for a little longer, and then glanced around the page. It was then I noticed that below the video, a button that read “Next Feed” had appeared without me noticing. I looked at the woman one last time before clicking on the button. The page took a moment to load, until suddenly the bare back of a woman sitting in a stall took up the frame of the video. I fumbled my hand around and hastily opened a new tab to clear my screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                I sat there, a little panicked, disgusted, embarrassed... I suppose any doubts I had about the website were cleared up now. It was indeed a site of camera feeds, and of course hidden cameras would be included too. I never really thought about it before going in. Guilt kept my hand still, hesitant to move the mouse back to the tab. I thought about the ethical implications of the site. It wasn’t okay to look at this at all, it was probably–no, definitely illegal, these people are oblivious to this, and there was no consent, this all felt so wrong to me, but… another part of me thought that maybe it just didn’t matter. I mean, I’m not doing anything to harm these people, they don’t know, so it’s not like they could get angry, and hey, what we don’t know can’t hurt us, right? My curiosity began to overtake my guilt. I looked at the tab. I thought for a moment more. My mouse was on the X.
                …I moved it back and opened the tab again.

            <h2>Chapter 2: Conversation</h2>
                
            <p>
                The coffee shop was quiet, with the exception of the gentle clacking of laptop keyboards, the faint hums of the machinery behind the countertop, and the sounds of me sipping a small cappuccino from a small styrofoam cup. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “So, how’s your job been?”, the office lady sitting across from me at the small table asked. Her hands were wrapped around another cup like mine, and she glanced up at me.
                “Oh, you mean at the store?”, I put down my cup and looked at it, smiling. “Well, for the small amount of time I’ve been there, it’s been good, peaceful, y’know?”
            </p>
            <p>
                She let out a small “hm” in response and continued, “Well, that’s good to hear…”
            </p> 
            <p>
                I looked up from my cup to her, “What about you?” 
            </p> 
            <p>
                “Well…”, her expression slowly frowned a little. “It just kind of sucks… I hate sitting around in a small cubicle, working on documents, I hate my boss, I…”, she grew agitated, but stopped herself and took a deep breath. “It’s not that great, honestly.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ah…” I picked my cup up and took a small sip out of it, putting it back down as soon as I finished. “I know how that is… my job was in an office too, like yours. I grew tired of it, and left… Maybe you should do the same too?”
            </p>
            <p>
                She looked down at her cup. “I can’t just do that, and you know that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I know, I know,” I sighed. “Maybe that was a little insensitive. I wish I could help somehow, you know, I–”
            </p>
            <p>
                “No no, it’s okay… you know, you just being here… and talking to me like this helps a little bit.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Really?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah, and I want to thank you for being there for me all the time.”
            </p>
            <p>
                A smile grew on my face. “Of course. I want to help you and be there for you. And you help me too.” It soon faded a little bit, “I.. don’t really have many people I can talk to like this, openly or anything like that.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well…”, she looked down at her drink and gave a little smile. “I’m glad we’re both here for each other. Me and y–” A buzz came from the purse she had by her seat. “Just a moment,” she dug her hand into her pocket and pulled out a phone. She stood up and whispered to me, “I’ll be back,” picking up her purse and walking towards the exit to the bright blankness outside. The buzzing ringed in my ears, even after she answered the phone. “Hello? Yeah, sorry, I’ll be back in a second, I was just talking to some creep.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                The word echoed in my mind, and my smile shattered. The whole world spun around and around as the blank void became so bright, I could see nothing, and the buzzing buzzed through it all, buzzing and buzzing and buzzing in my head with the echoes of her voice mixing and yelling into me until it all came to a stop. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The phone on my nightstand buzzed somewhat loudly. I slowly opened my eyes, adjusting to the slivers of light shining through the blinds. I turned myself around and picked up my phone to turn off the alarm. I slid my finger on the screen, bringing the buzzing to a silence. My head slumped back down to my pillow and I stared at the ceiling’s texture. I kept on staring, with nothing on my mind but the coffee shop, the office girl from the website, and the comment that tore into my mind and infested it, gnawing away at me.
