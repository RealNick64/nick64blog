    Made this sketch today, I think there are obviously some faults because I am in no way an expert at art or anything, but I'm honestly just proud of the progress I'm making. Granted, I did use a reference, but no tracing or anything, so I'm happy. I need to keep doing these so I can properly understand human proportions and draw better.
