Sometimes, I sit down at night and sketch (the best time for my productivity) and sometimes it feels good, and sometimes it feels bad. This feel really iffy tonight, leaning towards the negative side, but y'know what its ok i guess. I need to work on my writing more... Perhaps I will soon, I have been working on continuing my previous writing, I'm just thinking and writing as I go. I am on a tangent ok.
