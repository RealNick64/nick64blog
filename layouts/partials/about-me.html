<p>I'm <b>Nick64</b>, but you can just call me <b>Nick</b>. I'm (almost) 18, and I'm a little goofball with a little website.</p>
<p>I'm kind of an artsy guy, I like drawing, writing, that kind of stuff. I would like doing cooler things like making comics or novels if I had the motivation and self-confidence to do that. But when I'm not wallowing in self-doubt, I usually like watching a lot of movies and shows (maybe reading books from time to time too), and, sometimes, playing games as well.</p>
<p>I'm very much a lover of flashy and stylish things, filled with flair and funk.</p>
