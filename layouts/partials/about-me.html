<p>I'm <b>Nick64</b>, but you can just call me <b>Nick</b>. I'm 18 years old, and I'm a little zany goofball with a little zany website.</p>
<p>I'm kind of an artsy guy, I like drawing, writing, that kind of stuff. I would like doing cooler things like making comics or novels if I had the motivation and self-confidence to do that. But when I'm not wallowing in self-doubt, I usually like watching a lot of movies and shows (maybe reading books from time to time too), and, sometimes, playing games as well.</p>
<p>I'm very much a lover of flashy and stylish things, filled with flair and funk.</p>

<p>Very much a weeaboo, it's a consequence of being a weeaboo throughout my middle and high school years because it was easy to get anime for me, so if you dont like having a lot of anime, then you might not like this site (although I am working to really broaden my horizons on the media I consume) :)</p>
