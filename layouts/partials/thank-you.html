I want to thank my friends for being there and supporting me, I'm glad to have them in my life and they mean a lot to me and without them, I imagine things would be different (in a bad way).

    Also want to thank realjame of <span><a style="color: var(--main-color);" href="https://realja.me">realja.me</a></span> for helping me by giving me tips and advice for making the website and also giving me the idea to make a website for blogging and art stuff (thanks j).
